## üìä Statistical Model

We use a **linear regression model** to estimate height differences between male and female recruits.

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \cdots + \beta_n X_n + \epsilon
$$

with $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$

This model assumes:

- **Y** = outcome variable (height)  
- **X‚ÇÅ, X‚ÇÇ, ..., X‚Çô** = predictor variables (e.g., sex)  
- **Œ≤‚ÇÄ** = intercept (mean height for reference group)  
- **Œ≤‚ÇÅ, ..., Œ≤‚Çô** = effect of each predictor  
- **Œµ** = error not explained by predictors

## üß™ Data Generating Mechanism

We model the relationship using:

$$
\hat{\text{height}} = 162.18 + 15.94 \cdot \text{sexMale}
$$

This means males are predicted to be approximately 16 cm taller than females.

üìù **Summary of Analysis**

- Height is an important physical measurement that varies among individuals and may differ by sex.

- Using data from the NHANES survey (ages 18‚Äì27), we compare the average height between male and female recruits.

- One limitation is that this sample may not fully represent future recruit populations.

- We model average height ‚Äî a continuous variable ‚Äî as a linear function of sex, a binary variable.

‚úÖ Result: The average predicted height for male recruits is about 178 cm, with a 95% confidence interval from 175 to 181 cm.
