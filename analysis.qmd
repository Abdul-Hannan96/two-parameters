$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_n X_n + \epsilon
$$

with $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$

This is the general form of a **linear regression model**.

- **Y** is the **outcome variable** we want to predict ‚Äî in this case, height.
- **X‚ÇÅ, X‚ÇÇ, ..., X‚Çô** are the **predictor variables** (also called covariates) like sex or age.
- **Œ≤‚ÇÄ** is the **intercept**, the expected value of Y when all X‚Äôs are 0.
- **Œ≤‚ÇÅ, Œ≤‚ÇÇ, ..., Œ≤‚Çô** are the **coefficients** that show how much each predictor contributes to Y.
- **Œµ** (epsilon) is the **error term**, representing variation not explained by the model. It is assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance œÉ¬≤.

This model helps us understand how different variables are related

## üìù Summary of Analysis

Height is an important physical measurement that varies among individuals and may differ by sex.  
Using data from the **NHANES** survey, which includes a range of physical attributes for individuals aged 18‚Äì27, we aim to compare the average height between **male** and **female** recruits.
One potential limitation is that our data may not fully represent the future recruit population, which could bias our height estimates.
